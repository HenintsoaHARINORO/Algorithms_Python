A graph models a set of connections.Each graph is made up of nodes and edges
##G(V,E):Vertices/nodes and edges
##Two types of graphs:
 -directed graphs
 -undirected graphs
 
##Adjacency matrices:
A(i,j):1 if there is a connection between node i and node j
       otherwise 0

##Edge list representation
-create a Vertex class to store the neighbors(nodes) accordingly

- a tree structure must be connected and can never have loops while in the graph there are no such restrictions.
