#Light Switches
##Problem
You are in a hallway next to three light switches, all of which are off. Each switch activates a different incandescent light bulb in the room at the end of the hall. You cannot see the lights from where the switches are. Your task is to determine which light corresponds to each switch. However, you may go into the room with the lights only once.
##Solution
So the solution is to turn on switch 1 and wait for 15 minutes until that corrresponding bulb is hot. Then turn it off and turn on switch 2 then head to the room. Then you know that:\n",
    
* The bulb which is hot corresponds to switch 1,
* The bulb which is on corresponds to switch 2,
* The bulb which is off corresponds to switch 3
