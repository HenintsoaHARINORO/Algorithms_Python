##TREE
A tree is like linked list but instead of each node pointing simply to the next node in linear fashion,each node points to a number of nodes.

An example of non-linear data structure.
 
 #The root of a tree is the node with no parents
 #A node with no children is a leaf node
 #Children of same parent are called siblings
 #The set of all nodes at a given depth is called the level of the tree
 #The depth of a Node:the length of the path fro the root to the node
 #The height of a Node:the length of the path from that node to the deepest node
