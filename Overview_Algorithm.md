# Data
     *Data Types:
         integer,float,double,character,string
         Primitive data types(system-defined data types):
         int,char,bool,double:The number of bits allocated for each primitive data types depends on the programming languages
     *Data Structures
         It is a way to organize data in order to manipulate them effeciently
         -Linear Data STructures:Linked-Lists,Stacks,Queues
         -Non-Liner Data Structures:Trees,graphs
     *Abstract Data Types

#Analysis of Algorithms:
     *It helps us to determine which algorithm is the most efficient in terms of time and space consumed
     *Types:-worst case:lowest
            -best case:fastest
            -average case
     *Big O notation:upper bound(wosrt case)
     *Omega :lower bound(best case)
     *Theta :average
