#Arrays
-must be the sane time
-use indices as keys
-we can access to any items in array using indexes

##Arrays operation:
add(as far as the array is not full): O(1) operation
-We can insert a given value with a given index
insert(23,1) but we have to shift values in order to able to insert a new one
O(n)  linear time complexity

Same operation for removal
O(1) for removing the last item
O(n) for removing items with given index
