#Binary Heap Implementation
 A complete binary tree is a tree in which each level has all of its nodes
 
 The most efficient way to add an item to a list is to simply append the item at the end of the list
 
 In order to keep the heap structure,we need to re arrange the heap.
 ##The parent element must be the minimum items
 So we need to compare and swap some items if it is necessary
 The minimum value in a tree must be the root of the tree
