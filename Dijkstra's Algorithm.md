#Dijkstra's Algorithm
-Find the cheapest node
-Update the costs of the neighbors of this node
-Repeat until you have done this for every node in the graph
-calculate the final path

A graph with weights is called a weighted graph. A graph without
weights is called an unweighted graph.

 -shortest path in an unweighted graph: breadth-first search
 -shortest path in a weighted graph: Dijkstra’s algorithm.
 
 - you can’t use negative-weight edges
with Dijkstra’s algorithm
-negative weight:Bellman-Ford algorithm
