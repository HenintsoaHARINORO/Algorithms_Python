#Heap
* basically a binary tree
* minimum heap:the lowest key is in the root node
*  maximum heap:the highest key is in the root node

## Heap Properties:
* complete
##Removing an item
* arbitrary node = O(N)
* exact node = O(logN)

##Running Time
* Memory Complexity:O(N)
* find the minimum/maximum:O(1)
 heapArray[0]
* insertion
