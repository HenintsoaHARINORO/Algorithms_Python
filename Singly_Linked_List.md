##Singly LinkedList
-an ordered list of items as individual Nodes
that have pointers to other Nodes

##firstNode=head
##lastNode= tail

O(1):constant time of insertions and deletions in any position
-flexible with the size

##Cons:
To access an element in a linked list, you need to take O(k) time to go from the head of the list to the kth element.
 In contrast, arrays have constant time operations to access elements in an array.
