#Sequential Search
* go through the data structure
* compare elements

##unordered list:
We should o to each element to find the target
* item is present:
  Best Case= 1
  Worst Case = n (at the last element)
  Average case = n/2
* item is not present:
   Best Case= n
  Worst Case = n
  Average case = n
  

##Ordered list
We only have to search until we reach an element which is a match or we search an element which is greater than the target
* item is present or not:
   Best Case= 1
  Worst Case = n (at the last element)
  Average case = n/2
